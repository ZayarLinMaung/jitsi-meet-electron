## Troubleshooting

### Screen Recording Issues

#### Recording Not Starting
1. **Permission Denied**: Make sure to:
   - Click "Allow" when browser asks for screen recording permission
   - Select the correct screen/window to record
   - Enable audio sharing if you want audio included

2. **Browser Not Supported**: 
   - Try using Chrome or Firefox for best compatibility
   - Update your browser to the latest version

#### No Audio in Recording
1. Make sure to check "Share audio" when selecting screen to record
2. Verify your system audio is working
3. Some browsers may not support audio recording with screen capture

#### File Not Downloaded
1. Check your browser's download settings
2. Look in your default Downloads folder
3. Check if downloads were blocked by browser security settings

### Server Recording Issues

#### "Local recording is either disabled or not supported"
- **Solution**: This error means the Jitsi server doesn't support local recording
- **Workaround**: Use Screen Recording mode instead (it's more reliable anyway)

#### Permission Issues
1. Verify you have moderator rights in the meeting
2. Check if server-side recording is configured properly
3. Contact your Jitsi server administrator

### General Issues

#### Recording Controls Not Visible
1. Make sure you're in a meeting (not on the welcome screen)
2. Check if the controls are hidden behind other UI elements
3. Try refreshing the meeting

#### Poor Recording Quality
1. **Screen Recording**: Ensure good internet connection for smooth capture
2. Close unnecessary applications to free system resources
3. Record with lower resolution if performance is poor

## Privacy Considerations

- **Screen Recording**: Only you have access to the recorded file
- **Server Recording**: Files may be stored on the server (check with administrator)
- **Always inform participants** when recording starts
- **Respect local privacy laws** and regulations
- **Be aware of data storage implications** for different recording modes

## Best Practices

### For Screen Recording
1. **Close unnecessary applications** before recording to reduce clutter
2. **Use fullscreen mode** for cleaner recordings
3. **Test audio levels** before important meetings
4. **Ensure stable internet** for smooth video capture
5. **Have sufficient disk space** for video files

### File Management
1. **Organize recordings** by date or meeting topic
2. **Backup important recordings** to cloud storage
3. **Delete old recordings** to free up disk space
4. **Consider file size** - meetings can generate large files

### Meeting Etiquette
1. **Announce when recording starts** to all participants
2. **Get consent** from participants when required
3. **Stop recording** during breaks or private discussions
4. **Share recordings responsibly** and only with authorized people

## Future Enhancements
